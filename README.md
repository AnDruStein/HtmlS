# What is HTMLS?
HTMLScript is an HTML wrapper, which is <br>
`more flexible` and `more user-friendly` than classic HTML <br>

# Advantages

* Does not require long installation ⚡ 
* Human friendly syntax 👌 
* Inline layout 📝 
* Built-in preload ✔ 
* Reusable styles 🎨 
* Fast css connection 🐇 
* Grouped elements 📚 
  
# Installation
First of all, link HTMLS module to your web page.
```HTML
<script src="https://roseinfire.github.io/HtmlS/begin.js"></script>
```
HTMLS is compiled inside any `<script>` tag specified as `text/htmls` or just `htmls`. <br>
#### Make sure to check out [HTMLS quick overview](QUICKOVERVIEW.md)📃.<br>
#### We also prepared standard [template for quick start](Form.html)🔨.

### About privacy
We `never track` anybody and `never make changes` to their websites. <br>
If your site is built from a local file, `no data is shared` from local file. <br>
If your site is hosted on a public server, then it is public. <br>
Keep in mind that HtmlS will not take responsibility, <br>
if you publish confidential information on the public server. <br>
When connecting external scripts (including this one) you give them access to your page. <br>
Be sure that you can trust connected scripts. That's why the HtmlS is an `open source` project.

### About advertisement
HtmlS itself `never uses advertisements` <br>
Everyone can use advertisements on his own site if it's built with htmls. <br>
The best support for our project is to either cotribute to it or give it a star. <br>
#
### About installation
If your site is built with a cross-site script, it won't work if the script isn't accessible. <br>
So better idea is to download htmls to your project's folder 📩 <br>
It accesses to load quicker and doesn't depend on us 🚀 <br>
To run script from a folder, you need a special attribute `host`<br>
set to HtmlS path including the domain. <br>
Note that you also may need to set it to localhost to test your site locally.
```HTML
<html host="https://website.com/path">
  <head>
     <script src="path/begin.js"></script>
  </head>
</html>
```
#
### About performance
Loading of Htmls usually takes about (0,3) sec. <br>
However, building a site may take significantly more time.
